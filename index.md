Why I Made SubZer0
on November 14 2020 My Minecraft Server Got Backdoored By Someone Going By The Name "ElevenXD" The Way They Got In Was A Custom Firmware Called "Hypixel.jar" It Was Supposed To Be A "Better Version Of PaperMC" But All It Was Is A Backdoored Outdated Version Of CraftBukkit That STOLE Server Files And Gave Them To Eleven
